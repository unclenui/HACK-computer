# HACK-computer
This is a simple Computer Architecture that I am going to build base on a Computer Architecture' course: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris. This course is available on Coursera.

# The interesting course
This course strongly emphasize the fact that NAND operations can do anything, even Computer Architecture.
You can actually represent every logical gates or even more - boolean function by using only NAND operations. For example, you can do NOT(x) by using (x NAND x) and do AND(x) = NOT(x AND y) = (x AND y) NAND (x AND y).
By representing 2 elementary operations: NOT, AND, you can cook everything in boolean functions.
